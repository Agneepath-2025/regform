   2. Swimmers are expected to report to their places on time. Failure to do so may result in disqualification from that particular event.   
   3. Not covering the whole distance, not finishing in the same lane as the one they started in, not making physical contact with the end of the pool while turning or finishing, pulling on the lane rope, and obstructing another swimmer will result in disqualification.
